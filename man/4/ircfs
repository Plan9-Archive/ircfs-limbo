.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Ircfs
maintains a connection to an irc server and exports it using styx.
Communication channels (irc channels or queries to users) are represented by directories with a unique sequence number as name.  The file
.I data
in these directories allow text to be read and written.
Other files, such as
.I ctl
allow execution of irc commands such as setting the topic and kicking people.  Directory ``0''
is always present, providing status messages such as irc connection errors and certain irc messages.

.SS Options
.TP
.BI -a " addr"
Use
.I addr
as irc server.  Note that ircfs does not automatically dial the irc server at startup.  Write the ``connect'' or ``reconnect'' command to
.I ctl
after startup to connect.
.TP
.BI -f " fromhost"
Make the connection from ip address or host name
.IR fromhost .
.TP
.BI -n " nick"
Use
.I nick
as nick when connecting.
.TP
.BI -l " logpath"
Log contents of the
.I data
files of all irc directories to files named
.IR logpath/name.log ,
where
.I name
is the channel or user name.
.TP
.B -d
Enable debugging.
.TP
.B -D
Print styx traces.

.SS Hierarchy
The following files are exported:
.TP
.B /ctl
The following commands are understood:
reconnect, connect
.IR "address nick [fromhost]" ,
disconnect,
quit
.IR [msg] ,
join
.IR "channel [key]" ,
away
.IR [msg] ,
back,
nick
.IR nick ,
umode
(to request the user mode),
whois
.IR nick ,
invite
.I "nick channel"
and
time,
version
and
ping
(these last three are ctcp messages).  Commands are issued directly to the irc server, possible responses can be read from the status directory data file
.IR /0/data .
.TP
.B /event
Reads from this read-only file will block until an event occurs, one event per line.  The first word indicates the type of event.
``new
.IR "n name" ''
indicates that a new directory
.I n
with
channel or user name
.I name
is available.
For example after a
.I join
or an incoming user query.
``del
.IR n ''
indicates directory
.I n
has been closed.
For example after a
.IR part .
Irc connection status changes are:
.IR connecting ,
.IR "connected nick" ,
.IR disconnected' ,
and
.I "nick nick",
with
.I nick
being our current or new nick name.
.TP
.B /nick
This read-only file returns our current nick or the nick that will be used when connecting.
.TP
.B /raw
Reading blocks until an irc message is read from or written to the irc server.  Such messages are returned with
.I <<<
or
.I >>>
prepended.  Writes to this file are passed on to the irc connection verbatim, such writes will also be read by readers of this file.
.TP
.B /n
Connection directory.  Each channel or user query is represented by a directory.  The special directory ``/0'' is reserved for connection status messages.
.TP
.B /n/ctl
Commands accepted by
.I /ctl
are also understood by
.IR /n/ctl ,
modulo some commands that do not work on the status directory.
Additional commands:
names, n,
me
.IR msg,
notice
.IR msg,
mode
.IR [mode] ,
part
.IR [msg] ,
topic
.IR [topic] .
The following commands only work on channels and require one or more user names as parameters:
kick, op, deop, ban, unban, voice, devoice .
.TP
.B /n/data
Data written to this file is sent to the channel or user query.  A write can contain multiple lines.  Reads on this file block until activity occurs on the channel or query.  After opening, reads will first return a backlog of text.  Each line will start with two characters, ``+ '' for normal text or ``# '' for meta text.  Meta text is information about the channel, such as users joining or leaving a channel, new topics, mode changes, etc.  These characters are nearly always followed by a time stamp of the form ``hh:mm '', followed by the text itself.  Also, every time the date changes, a line is printed.
.TP
.B /n/name
Reads return the name of the channel or the user.  For the status directory ``0'' the string ``(netname)'' is returned,
with
.I netname
from the command-line.  Read-only.
.TP
.B /n/users
Only useful if the directory represents an irc channel.  Reads return lines of the form ``+user'' and ``-user'' for joined, and parted or quit users.  This allows clients to keep track of who is currently in a channel.  Read-only.
.SH EXAMPLE
To run ircfs and export its files:
.EX
	ndb/cs
	# note: make sure the paths exist
	mount {ircfs -l $home/irclog/freenode -a net!irc.freenode.net!6667 \
		-n ircfsuser freenode} /mnt/irc/freenode
	styxlisten -A net!*!6872 {export /mnt/irc}

.SH BUGS
Ircfs does not provide information to readers whether data has been read.
.br
Day change messages are treated as ``meta'' text.  They should be of a lower importance.

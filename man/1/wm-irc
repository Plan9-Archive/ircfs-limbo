.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Wm/irc
is a Tk interface to irc file systems,
.IR ircfs (4).
The larger part of the window shows the communication of a channel or a user query.
Such a channel or user query is called an
.I "irc directory"
in ircfs, and corresponds to a
.I window
in wm/irc.
Below this main area, an input entry allows new text and commands to be sent.
Atop the main window are a button to plumb the current text selection,
a button to clear activity status for all windows,
and a search input entry with buttons for searching the previous and next match.
Left of these elements is a list with names of opened irc directories.
Selecting one displays it on the main area.
Text in the input entries and in the main text windows can be cut & pasted with mouse chording.

.PP
At startup, the
.I paths
given on the command-line are opened.
Each path should adhere to the file system layout served by ircfs.
All irc directories are opened as windows.

.PP
.B Wm/irc
strips specials characters that cause colours and underlines to be displayed in other irc clients from the input.
Only bold instructions are used, but drawn underlined.
Instances of
.I ircfs'
nick are highlighted in yellow.
Activity in a window is indicated in the list on the left, by a status character in front of the window name.
The status is kept clear while a window is visible.
The following status characters can appear, in decreasing priority:
.TP
.B =
Highlights and text in user queries.
.TP
.B +
Text in channels.
.TP
.B -
Meta information such as joins and topic changes.
.TP
.B ~
Only for server status windows.
Indicates a delay in the connection between wm/irc and ircfs, and/or between ircfs and its irc server.

.SS Options
.TP
.B -s
Do not automatically add windows for all irc directories ircfs knows.
By default, each directory is opened.
.TP
.BI -g " width height"
Set the window size to
.IR "width x height" .
.TP
.BI -h " histsize"
Do not read more than
.I histsize
bytes of backlog from ircfs when opening a new window.
Useful on slow connections.
.TP
.BI -r " hlregex"
Highlight text matches
.I hlregex
too.
Can be specified multiple times.
The own nick is always hightlighted.
.TP
.B -d
Enable debugging output.

.SS Commands
Commands can be entered in the input entry at the bottom of the screen.
Lines starting with a slash are treated as commands.
Lines starting with two slashes are treated as text with one slash removed.
Wm/irc handles the command
.I /win
itself, all other commands are passed on the
.I ctl
file of the corresponding irc directory.
See
.IR ircfs (4)
for commands understood by ircfs.

The parameters to
.I /win
are itself considered as a command:
.TP
.BR exit " or " quit
Exit
.BR wm/irc .
It does not issue a quit command to ircfs.
.TP
.BI add " path"
Start serving the ircfs from mount point
.IR path .
Unless

was specified, a window is opened for each irc directory.
.TP
.BI del
Remove all references (including windows) to the ircfs of the current window.
.TP
.BI open " id"
Open the irc directory
.I id
of the ircfs of the current window, e.g.
.IR /mnt/irc/ircnet/id/ .
.TP
.B close
Closes the current
.IR window .
Note that it does not issue a
.L part
command to ircfs.
Use ircfs's
.I remove
command to part the irc directory and afterwards close the window.

	mount {ircfs freenode} /mnt/irc/freenode
	wm/irc /mnt/irc/freenode

Plumbing requires button.
.PP
Ircfs has no way of letting wm/irc know which data has been read before, e.g. by a recent invocation of wm/irc.
At startup, wm/irc is likely to generate status changes (e.g. highlights) for events that have already been seen by the user.

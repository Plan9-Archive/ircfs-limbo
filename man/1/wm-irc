.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Wm/irc
is a Tk interface to irc file systems as served by
.IR ircfs (4).
The main text area contains the communication of a channel or a user query.  Such a channel or user query is called an
.I "irc directory"
in ircfs, and corresponds to a
.IR window
in wm/irc.
Below this main window, an input entry allows new text and commands to be sent.
Atop the main window are buttons to snarf, paste or plumb the current text selection,
and an input entry and find-button to search for text.
Left of these elements is a listing with names of opened irc directories.  Selecting one displays it on the main text area.

.PP
At startup, the
.I paths
given on the command-line are opened.  Each path should adhere to the file system layout served by ircfs.
All irc directories are opened as windows.

.PP
.B Wm/irc
strips specials characters from the input that cause colors, underlines and bold fonts to be displayed in other irc clients.
Occurrences of our nick name are highlighted in yellow.
Activity on windows is shown by a single character left to the name of the window, in the list on the left.  The status is cleared (the character set to a space) when a window is shown.  Highlights and text in user queries have the highest priority and are displayed as a `=';  text in channels is displayed as a `+';  meta information (such as joins and topic changes) is displayed as `-'.

.SS Options
.TP
.B -d
Enable debugging output.
.TP
.B -s
Do not automatically add windows for all `irc directories' ircfs knows.  By default, each directory is opened.
.TP
.BI -h " histsize"
Do not read more than
.I histsize
bytes of backlog from ircfs when opening a new window.  Useful on slow connections.

.SS Commands
Commands can be entered in the input entry at the bottom of the screen.
All lines starting with a slash are treated as commands.
Lines starting with two slashes are treated as text with one of the slashes removed.
.B Wm/irc
determines whether the command is one of its own known commands and handles it immediately if so.
Otherwise, it written to the
.I ctl
file of the corresponding irc directory.
See
.IR ircfs (4)
for commands understood by ircfs.

Commands handled by wm/irc:
.TP
.B close
Closes the current
.I window
and corresponding irc directory.
It does not issue any kind of close or quit command to ircfs.

.TP
.B windows

.I Open
are those currently open as a window in wm/irc and alive at ircfs.
.I Unopen
targets are those alive at ircfs but not opened in wm/irc.

.SH EXAMPLE
To start and mount a new ircfs and use it from wm/irc:
.EX
	mkdir /mnt/irc
	mkdir /mnt/irc/freenode
	mount {ircfs freenode} /mnt/irc/freenode
	wm/irc /mnt/irc/freenode

	# now type this in the input entry at the bottom to connect as "inferno":
	/connect net!irc.freenode.net!6667 inferno

	# and to join a channel "inferno"
	/join #inferno

.SH BUGS
Plumbing and snarf & paste are done using buttons.  Using acme chording, such as implemented in
.IR wm/sh (1),
would be much better.
.br
Since ircfs has no way of letting wm/irc now which data has been read before (e.g. by a recent invocation of wm/irc), wm/irc is likely to generate status changes (e.g. highlights) for events that have already been seen by the user.
